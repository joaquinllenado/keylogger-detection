# **Before starting:**

## Install Packages
1. pip install pandas
2. pip install scikit-learn
3. pip install matplotlib
4. pip install scapy
5. pip install psutil

## Download dataset
CSV file was too large to upload here, so here is the open-source data we used:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/keylogger-detection/data

## Run malicious-software-detection.ipynb

This is needed to generate the keylogger-detection-model file (it was also too large to upload on GitHub)

# Good to go, now:
Run app.py

Current prediction rate ~96.5%
